## DSTORE V1.0 - OPENWRT APPT STORE

### How to use DStore
- First, fork this repository: https://github.com/dotywrt/doty_store
- Navigate to the `app/` directory and create a folder for your app, e.g., `passwall/` or `passwall2/`
- Upload your `.ipk` file into that folder.
- (Optional) To add an image for your app in the store, upload any image file (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`) into the same folder.
- Once you're done, take a break—or even smoke a cigarette, haha.
- Go to the **Actions** tab in GitHub and run the workflow to automatically generate `store.json`.
- After `store.json` is generated, copy the URL to the file.
- On your OpenWRT device, go to **DStore > Settings**, paste the URL, save, and update.
